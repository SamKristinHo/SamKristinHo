## Hello! My name is Samantha. 

I am an entry level Software Engineering candidate who recently graduated from my Master's degree in Computer Science from The Georgia Institute of Technology. My specialization was in Artificial Interactive Intelligence - understanding the theories and academic foundations that drive interactive AI agents - such as robotic vaccum cleaners, voice assistants, and chess engines! I find ubiqutous interactions with AI agents in our daily lives to be the most exciting part of the evolultion of AI. 

I have professional experience focusing on backend engineering, REST APIs, OpenAI integration, test-driven development, and backend architecture. I am currently seeking my first full time role in Software or Data Engineering. During this process, I will be working on personal projects in full-stack development, Machine Learning, and Open Source Software Contributions.
